# movie-rec-engine-backend
This repo contains the code required to build out the Flask API for Movie Recommendation engine based on the MovieLens dataset. I did this project to learn more about microservice architectures and create a real-world product that can help people out the next time they have friends over and are trying to decide what to watch next.
