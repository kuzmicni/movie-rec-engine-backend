# movie-rec-engine-backend
This repo contains the code required to build out the Flask API for Movie Recommendation engine based on the MovieLens dataset. I did this project to learn more about microservice architectures and create a real-world product that can help people out the next time they have friends over and are trying to decide what to watch next. 

To run the code you will also need to download the csv file from google drive and place it inside the root directory.
