# movie-rec-engine-backend
Here you can find the code to build out the backend Flask API for Movie Recommendation engine. I created this project to leverage the open-source MovieLens dataset and hopefully help people the next time they run out of good Netflix recommendations. Below is an illustration of what the engine will recommend if your favourite movie is 'Heat (1995)'. You can also try it out base on your favourite movie on: mynextmovie.ca(https://mynextmovie.ca/).

To run the code you will also need to download the csv file from google drive and place it inside the root directory.
