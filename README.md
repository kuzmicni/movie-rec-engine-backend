# movie-rec-engine-backend

Here you can find the Movie Recommendation engine backend Flask API code. 

I created this project to leverage the open-source [MovieLens dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) and hopefully help people figure out what to watch next. Below is an illustration of what the engine will recommend enter movie 'Heat (1995)'. You can also try it out based on your favourite movie on: [mynextmovie.ca](https://mynextmovie.ca).

To run the code you will also need to download the csv file from google drive and place it inside the root directory.
